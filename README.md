# iOS 11 Jailbreak
## Target
This jailbreak is for iOS 11.1.2 (15B202).  If you don't have this *exact* version it won't work for you
## How to Install
Load and run the XCode project or sideload the IPA using Cydia Impactor. For more complete / visual instructions see the iOS_jailbreak_writeup.pdf "How to jailbreak your phone" section.
## Version 0.3a
Several stability bugs have been fixed, tfp0 is now inserted into hsp4 so any application running as root has kernel access. The live kernel introspection webserver has been moved out of the jailbreak and into a binary dropped on the system, and relies on hsp4 for kernel access.

More bugs and extra features are planned for 0.4, see the issues sections for more information or to report a bug.
## Copyright
I could have copy-pasta'd MIT or BSD, but it boils down to this: credit the authors.  This jailbreak is released as 100% open-source to help the security community.  Feel free to take the code, use it how you wish, just keep in mind that if it's my code, attribute me BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY if I used someone else's code or ideas, make sure to credit them and *respect their licenses* (QiLin, especially). My goal is for this code to help the security community and vulnerability research in general, so don't use it commercially.  Let information be free!
